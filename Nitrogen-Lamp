This is the process of creating the nitrogen lamp, hypothesis and method of experiment. 

Explanation:

Nitrogen is a non-flammable, colourless, odourless, and tasteless gas that makes up about 78% of the Earth's atmosphere.
With an atomic number of 7, Nitrogen is low density and is a crutial role in science and nature. It works as a replacement
for neon in a neon lamp, but not well. The color shifts — not the sharp orange-red like neon. Nitrogen gives a dim violet-pink,
and it’s not consistent. That’s probably because it’s a diatomic gas, so the emission comes from molecular transitions, not atomic 
lines like neon. Less efficient, more spread out across the spectrum. Breakdown voltage is noticeably higher. Neon fires up at around 90V
in a standard tube, but nitrogen needs over 200V to sustain a glow. That tracks with Paschen’s curve — more energy needed to ionize N₂ molecules.
And once it's running, the discharge is unstable. Flickers a lot unless the pressure and electrode distance are dialed in perfectly.

Requirements:

In a normal neon lamp, for example the old ones made by General Electric (GE), the envelope is made from glass and has a size of around
10mm. 2 electrodes would be inside, made from either nickel or iron, with about 2mm of space between (depending on size). Then the desired gas would fill the
glass tube at low pressure. The pressure would only be a mere 1 to 20 torr; for context the air pressure is around 760 torr.
